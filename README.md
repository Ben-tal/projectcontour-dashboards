# [Contour Ingress Metrics Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21396-contour-ingress-metrics/)

## Overview
The [contour-ingress-metrics](./contour-ingress-metrics.json) Grafana dashboard comprehensively monitors the Project Contour Ingress Controller at the service level, offering a detailed view of various service-level statistics. The dashboard is designed to help you understand the performance, availability, and overall health of your ingress resources.

## Dashboard Sections

### 1. Overview
- **Requests (period)**: Displays the total number of ingress requests over a specific period.
- **Connections (period)**: Shows the total number of active connections during the period.
- **% Success (period)**: Percentage of successful requests over the period.
- **Requests (5m)**: Number of requests received in the last 5 minutes.
- **Connections (5m)**: Number of connections in the last 5 minutes.
- **% Success (5m)**: Success rate of requests in the last 5 minutes.
- **HTTP Status Codes (5m)**: Breakdown of HTTP status codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for the last 5 minutes.

### 2. Request Information
- **Ingress Success Requests (non 4|5xx Responses)**: Rate of successful ingress requests.
- **Ingress Failed Requests (4|5xx Responses)**: Rate of failed ingress requests.
- **Ingress Success Rate (non-4|5xx Responses)**: Success rate of ingress requests excluding 4xx and 5xx responses.

### 3. Service Summary
- **Ingress**: Overall ingress metrics.
- **Requests Per Second**: Rate of incoming requests per second.
- **Connections Per Second**: Rate of active connections per second.

### 4. Throughput
- **Upstream Network Traffic**: Network traffic to upstream services.

### 5. Requests
- **Total Active Requests**: Current active requests being processed.
- **New Requests**: Rate of new requests coming in.
- **Ingress Request Volume**: Volume of ingress requests over time.

### 6. Connections

# [Contour Global Metrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21402-contour-global-metrics/)
A Dashboard that monitors general statistics for Contour Ingress Controller (Projectcontour)

## Overview
The [contour-global-metrics](./contour-global-metrics.json) monitors general and more global statistics for Contour Ingress Controller. It displays real-time metrics for requests, connections, memory usage, and node status to help maintain and optimize performance.

## Features
- Requests Per Second (RPS)
- Active Requests
- Connections Per Second (CPS)
- Active Connections
- Memory Usage
- Node Status
- HTTPProxy Resource Status

## Downstream listener scope

The global dashboard's downstream request and connection counts, rates, active gauges, and network traffic include only `ingress_http` and `ingress_https`. Management connection managers such as `admin` and `stats` are excluded. Upstream panels continue to measure backend cluster traffic.
